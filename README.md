# Dirge of Sorrows
### This is the source code for a low-fantasy RPG turn-based strategy auto-battler game (e.g. like Ogre Battle) being built using OP Game Engine in VS 2022.
#
# Current state: Unplayable Alpha
###### Releases will only be available up through Beta state of the game prior to actual release on Steam, but code changes will stay updated on here and remain available for those who wish to compile their own modded version. After release of the game, the game will need to be purchased on Steam to acquire media files for the Content folder (e.g. music, sounds, and textures).
# 
### Features currently in the game:
- Random generation of worldmap with levels to progress through marked on the map (click location to enter map for that level)
- Random generation of levels/local-maps with starting player base/town, enemy base, neutral towns, merchant town, academy town
- Capturing/liberating neutral towns (flipping them to player-controlled)
- Level/area/map progression, displaying next location(s) on worldmap
- A* pathing for player squad token movement on map
- Starting character generation screen
- Equippable items and viewing equipment stats
- Menu for managing squads in player army
- Menu for managing character formation in a squad
- Menu for managing character equipped gear
- Menu for managing rune attachments in items/gear
- Menu for viewing general inventory of player army
- Menu for buying/selling items in shops
- Menu for purchasing more characters at academy towns
- Combat screen and basic combat mechanics

- Dispatching additional squads to player base on map
- Context menu to handle selection of a squad when there's multiple in one location
#
### Planned features not yet implemented:
- Right-clicking squads on map to view their characters/formation
- Maybe very slow income/gold generation from controlled towns (not sure about this yet since it can easily break the game economy/progression)
- Generation of enemy squads on maps with increasing amount/difficulty/equipment
- AI to control enemy squad movement on map
- Enemy squads capturing towns
- Losing game (or just the level?) if enemy squad reaches player base
- Character stat/xp/level progression
- Maybe character skill progression (e.g. an Armor skill that increases Physical Defense and decreases EP Cost of armor)
- Adding more music for variety
- Hopefully some graphical improvements, since I'm a terrible graphics artist
- Story/lore and tutorial
