# Dirge of Sorrows
### This is the source code for a low-fantasy RPG turn-based strategy auto-battler game (e.g. like Ogre Battle) being built using OP Game Engine in VS 2022.
#
# Current state: Unplayable Alpha
###### Releases will only be available up through Beta state of the game prior to actual release on Steam, but code changes will stay updated on here and remain available for those who wish to compile their own modded version. After release of the game, the game will need to be purchased on Steam to acquire media files for the Content folder (e.g. music, sounds, and textures).
# 
### Features currently in the game:
- Random generation of worldmap with levels to progress through marked on the map (click location to enter map for that level)
- Random generation of levels with starting player base/town, enemy base, neutral towns, merchant town, academy town
- A* pathing for player squad token movement on map
- Starting character generation screen
- Equippable items and viewing equipment stats
- Menu for managing squads in player army
- Menu for managing character formation in a squad
- Menu for managing character equipped gear
- Menu for managing rune attachments in items/gear
- Menu for viewing general inventory of player army
#
### Planned features not yet implemented:
- Context menu to handle multiple possible interactions at a location (e.g. selecting a squad or entering town the squad is at)
- Menu for possible locations within a town to interact with (e.g. item shop, character recruitment, tavern to get story/lore bits from, etc)
- Menu for item trading in shops at merchant towns
- Menu for purchasing more characters at academy towns
- Dispatching additional squads
- Right-clicking squads on map to view their characters/formation
- Context menu to handle selection of a squad when there's multiple in one location
- Capturing/liberating neutral towns (flipping them to player-controlled)
- Maybe very slow income/gold generation from controlled towns (not sure about this yet since it can easily break the game economy/progression)
- Combat screen and general combat mechanics
- AI to control enemy squad movement on map
- Enemy squads capturing towns
- Losing game (or just the level?) if enemy squad reaches player base
- Story/lore
- Level/area progression, displaying next location(s) on worldmap
- Character stat progression
- Maybe character skill progression (e.g. an Armor skill that increases Physical Defense and decreases EP Cost of armor)
- Replacement of placeholder music
- Hopefully some graphical improvements, since I'm a terrible graphics artist
