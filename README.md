### A low-fantasy RPG/Strategy auto-battler game (e.g. like Ogre Battle) built with [OP Game Engine](https://github.com/Oblivionburn/OP_Engine).
<br><br>
# Current state: Beta
>[!NOTE]
>Releases will only be available on github up through Beta (v0.9.X.X) state of the game, but source code will stay updated for those who wish to see the inner-workings of the game, its history of changes, and/or to compile their own modded version.
><br><br>After 1.0 release, the game will need to be purchased on Steam to acquire the needed media files (e.g. music, sounds, and textures) for the game to function.

## <ins>Features</ins>:
- **Auto-battler combat**
  - 3x3 squad formations - position in the formation effects targeting, damage dealt, and damage received
  - No classes - characters are what they wear
<br><br>
- **Randomly generated Worldmap with 20 battle locations to unlock**
  - Selecting a location takes you to a Local Map where battle takes place
<br><br>
- **Randomly generated Local Maps consisting of:**
  - Player Base - where all your squads will deploy at the start of the map
  - Enemy Base - must be captured to win the map
  - Market Town - where you can purchase armor/weapons to equip your characters with
  - Academy Town - where you can recruit more characters for your army
  - Neutral Towns to capture for passive gold income - 1 gold per town (across all maps) per in-game day
  - Roads and various types of terrain effecting movement speed
  - Biome aesthetic based on Worldmap position
<br><br>
- **Individual character XP/Level progression and 4 combat stats:**
  - Strength - effects melee/bow weapon damage
  - Intelligence - effects grimoire (magic) weapon damage
  - Dexterity - effects chance to hit with melee/bow weapons
  - Agility - effects chance to dodge melee/bow weapon attacks
    - Dodge Chance(%) = Defender's Agility - Attacker's Dexterity, so dodging rarely happens
  - Note: stat increases per Level happen automatically based on equipped weapon
<br><br>
- 15 types of Runes that can be attached to armor/weapons, and paired for various effects (similar to FF7 materia system), with XP/Level progression which increases their effectiveness
