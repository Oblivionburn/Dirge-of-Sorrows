# Dirge of Sorrows
### This is the source code for a low-fantasy RPG/Strategy auto-battler game (e.g. like Ogre Battle) being built using [OP Game Engine](https://github.com/Oblivionburn/OP_Engine) in VS 2022.
#
# Current state: Playable Alpha
######
>[!NOTE]
>Releases will only be available up through Beta state of the game prior to actual release on Steam, but code changes will stay updated on here and remain available for those who wish to compile their own modded version. After release of the game, the game will need to be purchased on Steam to acquire media files for the Content folder (e.g. music, sounds, and textures).
#
### Features currently in the game:
- Auto-battler combat with 3x3 squad formations
- Randomly generated Worldmap with 20 locations that can be clicked to enter their Local Map
- Randomly generated Local Maps consisting of:
  - 1 Player Base
  - 1 Enemy Base (capturing it completes a map)
  - At least 1 Market Town to purchase equipment
  - At least 1 Academy Town to recruit more characters
  - Neutral Towns to capture/liberate
- Randomly generated enemy squads in every Local Map which increase in amount/difficulty/equipment across locations on the Worldmap
- Capturing/liberating towns yields 1 gold each, every in-game hour (stacks across every map)
- Individual character XP/Level progression with 4 combat stats: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, and Agility
- Armor/Weapons that can be equipped on characters
- 14 types of Runes that can be attached to armor/weapons and paired for various effects (similar to FF7 materia system), which also have XP/Level progression to increase their effectiveness over time
- Intro of the story, which also serves as the tutorial for the game
#
### Planned features not yet implemented:
- More Story/Lore
- Side-quests for special armor/weapons
- Finding hidden items in the world
- More music for variety
- Hopefully some graphical improvements
